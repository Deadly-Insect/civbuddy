Credits

Civbuddy reuses the following work by other authors:

- Robert Kieffer's Javascript to generate RFC4122(v4) compliant UUIDs in a version of 2012-02-19, which is dual
  licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses. It is kept in its own file at war/uuid.cache.js, including Robert's
  credits.

- Some design elements and ideas from Christopher Plieger's iWebKit 5.04. iWebKit was used for design inspiration,
  but only a small handful of icons, and no actual code of iWebKit were used. The actual iWebKit itself was not
  used. Since CivBuddy is a free and private project, iWebKit is free to use for CivBuddy.
