# CivBuddy (v2)

**Original Civilization Board Game Utility**

CivBuddy is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's
[original Civilization board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980)
by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards. It supports multiple variants of the game, including
[Advanced Civilization](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991).

This is not a computer game, but a helper application for the board game. In later stages of the game,
the rules of the board game lead to phases of long-winded calculations in the upper three-digit numbers.
With CivBuddy, this can be solved quickly and easily, so everyone can concentrate on the fun parts of the game.

### Status

The contents of this repository is currently under construction. In fact, it is currently being dumped into,
so it is not even in a state where someone else could contribute. Please bear with me to get it cleaned up.
As soon as that happens, I'll change this message.

This repository is where the next version of CivBuddy is currently being created. While the
[old CivBuddy](https://github.com/tsjensen/civbuddy) was based on [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) technology,
this new version is based on TypeScript and HTML/CSS alone. Thus, we hope to create a more responsive
experience with better modern day browser support.

CivBuddy v1 is no longer maintained. All changes currently go into v2.
