# CivBuddy (v2)

**Original Civilization Board Game Utility**

CivBuddy is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's
[original Civilization board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980)
by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards. It can support multiple variants of the game,
including
[Advanced Civilization](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991).

This is not a computer game, but a helper application for the board game. In later stages of the game,
the rules of the board game lead to phases of long-winded calculations in the upper three-digit numbers.
With CivBuddy, this can be solved quickly and easily, so everyone can concentrate on the fun parts of the game.

CivBuddy is a free web application, so you can just [use it right now](http://app2.civbuddy.org/)! :tada:

### Status

The application is feature complete, but there are still some rough edges (especially browser support, so you might
want to use Chrome for now). We are stable enough that it is worth leaving a bug report in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/tsjensen/civbuddy2/issues) should you notice anything wrong or missing.

The [old CivBuddy application](https://github.com/tsjensen/civbuddy) (v1), which was based on
[GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) technology, is no longer maintained. All changes currently go into v2.
