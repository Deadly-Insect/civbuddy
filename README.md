# CivBuddy

**Utility webapp for friends of the original Civilization board game**

CivBuddy is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's original Civilization board game by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards.
It has no artificial intelligence, and it does not play the game for you. This is also not a computer game. The players gain no tactical advantage, but it saves time for everyone so that all players can concentrate on the fun parts of the game.

- It supports multiple players ("hot seat"), which is useful if there are fewer smartphones than players
- It works on mobile devices as well as desktop PCs, on all modern operating systems
- Although it's a web app, it may be used offline
- Full privacy: All data is saved in your web browser, nothing is transmitted to the server
- It can be taught to know your house rules (within limits)
- Three game variants already supported ([original](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980), [with western expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/2058/civilization-western-extension-map) (1988), and [advanced](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991))
